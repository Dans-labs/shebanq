# Controllers

The controllers can be grouped as follows.

## Default

### ::: controllers.default

## Feed

### ::: controllers.feed

## Hebrew

In *hebrew.py*.

The significant controllers are all here.
Their bodies are very short, because they all
call a function from the modules, which does all the work.

The modules are [individually documented](bymodule/index.md) 
by docstrings in the code.

### ::: controllers.hebrew
