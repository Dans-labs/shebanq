<h5>2015-01-21</h5>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>performance improvements</dt>
<dd>Executing queries is faster, because the storing of query results has been implemented better.</dd>
<dt>mainainability improved</dt>
<dd>A major hoop has been removed concerning query execution. Before this change, a query was sent to a tomcat service,
that talked through Java bindings with Emdros. Now, Shebanq, which is written in Python, talks directly through Python
bindings with Emdros. This will help future additions of functionality greatly, and it makes Shebanq much easier to
install and maintain. It seems that the performance benefits for individual queries.
It remains to be seen how performance will keep up when doing many concurrent queries.</dd>

<h5>2015-01-15</h5>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>csv export</dt>
<dd>From the page that shows a list of query results of word occurrence results, you can download a customizable csv file of
the listed items. Each item occupies a row in which also the passage is indicated.
We hope this helps for getting data ready for statistical analysis.</dd>

<h5>2014-07-29</h5>
SHEBANQ goes live, but it is a demonstrator, with open issues.
Currently we are aware of:
<ol class="text">
    <li>The query engine might cause exceptions that are not yet handled</li>
    <li>The rendering of the spacing between words is not completely correct, at least in Chrome.
        We have tried
        <a target="_blank" href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ETCBC/laf-fabric-nbs/blob/master/text/font-rendering.ipynb">very hard</a>
        to work around the issues, so that you can enjoy the otherwise beautiful typography even on your iPad.
        N.B.: to our great pleasure we obeserved that as of Safari 7.1 on OSX 10.9.5 there is no need for a work-around anymore.
</ol>
