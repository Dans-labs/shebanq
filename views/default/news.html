<dt>Feature index</dt>
<dd>A tree-like index of objects and features that can be used in queries would be helpful for users when they are developing MQL queries.</dd>
<dt>Searching within queries</dt>
<dd>Now the number of queries is in the hundreds, we need more ways to search them. At the moment there is not a full text search on the 
mql bodies of the queries. I plan to add this as an extra filter.</dd>
<dt>Structured query results</dt>
<dd>At the moment, SHEBANQ transforms the results of a query into a plain set of words. But query results have an internal structure.
It would be nice to preserve that structure, and to make use of it.</dd>
<dt>Migration to KNAW server</dt>
<dd>We will migrate SHEBANQ from the current (commercial) Leaseweb server to a new KNAW/DANS (institutional) server.
We intend to keep the Leaseweb server for hosting SHEBANQ-beta, where we stage new changes before we apply them to the production SHEBANQ.
Up till now, using SHEBANQ is sometimes a rough ride for you, with a rush of updates and new annoying bugs every now and then.
By using a test server we hope to improve on that.</dd>
<dt>Deleting queries</dt>
<dd>Now you cannot delete queries, yet it is a legitimate whish to erase your obsolete queries.
But what if they have been published? Currently you can unpublish queries, but what if somebody else maintains a link to such a query?</dd>

<dt>Phonetic transcriptions</dt>
<dd>You can now choose whether you want to see the Hebrew text in Hebrew script or in phonetic transcription.
The phonetic transcription that SHEBANQ shows is the result of a freshly made, exquisite set of rules.
Yet I am sure that there will be mistakes.
If you stumble on mistakes, you can use SHEBANQ itself write them down.
Just go to notes view, and make a note.
Please give those notes the keyword <code>phono</code>, then I can collect them.

<dt>Verbal valence</dt>
<dd><p>The meaning of a verb is strongly dependent on the patterns of constituents in the clause. Janet Dyk and Reinoud Oosting and Oliver Glanz
are researching the the nature of this dependency. Results of this study will be incorporated into SHEBANQ.
Think of a context-dependent refinement of the glosses for verbs, including the reasons why a particular gloss has been suggested in a particular context.<p>
<p>This is really work in progress.
That is why we do not incorporate valence data into the ETCBC database yet, but we do make our results available as <b>notes</b>.
These notes areactually generated with the help of LAF-Fabric.
See the <a target="_blank" href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/etcbc/laf-fabric-nbs/blob/master/valence/flowchart.ipynb">flowchart notebook</a>, and see the

<dt>Modified notes view</dt>
<dd><p>The tabbed views named after Nicolai, Oliver and Dirk, now have names that are more indicative to what you see:
<i>notes</i>, <i>syntax</i>, and <i>abstact</i>.</p>
<p>Notes view has been upgraded: the numbers of the phrases are also shown. So you can refer to them in your notes.</p>
<p>Muting now also works in notes view, so you can focus on the notes sets that you are working with.</p>

boundaries cut through phrases.</p>
<p>Note that the subphrase numbers as shown in SHEBANQ are not part of the ETCBC database.
I have put them in for SHEBANQ in order to show where the subphrases are.
Subphrases may overlap, each word carries the numbers of all subphrases it belongs to.
Subphrase-numbering is relative to the container phrase.

<p>A fair update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tabbed views and visualisations: experimental</dt>
<dd><p>Our key users have proposed alternative ways for displaying the texts.
We provide a text view, lined up per <i>clause_atom</i>, with a layout that shows the indentation and text structure a bit more.
There are several layouts, which will evolve further. Currently we have one in the style of Nicolai Winther-Nielsen, and one in the style of Oliver Glanz.
See the <i>tab</i> control at the top right of the window.
See these help pages:
<a href="{{=URL('default','help')}}#nicolai_style">Nicolai style</a>,
<a href="{{=URL('default','help')}}#oliver_style">Oliver style</a>.
</p>
<p>Besides the tabbed views, there is also an iconic visualization of the text, which shows a very abstract rendering of the text.
See <a href="{{=URL('hebrew','text', vars=dict(version='4',tp='txt_tb3'))}}">Dirk's visualization</a>.
You can still highlight queries and words and call up the underlying data from this view.
So you can switch back and forth between <i>distant</i> and <i>close</i> reading.</p>
<p>If you have comments or suggestions, consider tweeting them to @shebanq_. You can use the buttons on this page.
If you have a proposal for yet another view on the text, then your suggestion is very welcome!</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cite page content</dt>
<dd><p>It is now easy to copy and paste a SHEBANQ page with Hebrew material to an other application.
This is handy when you are preparing hand-outs for classes.
Once a SHEBANQ page is pasted in your application, you can edit the content, and put your own notes in.
The content you copy always contains a link to the live SHEBANQ page from where it has been copied.</p>
<ul class="ldisc">
<li>For best results, ensure that you have a good Hebrew font installed on your system, e.g. Ezra SIL or SBL Hebrew.</li>
<li>Also install <a href="http://fontawesome.io">FontAwesome</a> on your system, this contains the special symbols.
After downloading, double-click the file <code>fonts/FontAwesome.otf</code> to install the font on your system.</li>
<li>Not all browsers copy the HTML in the right way to the clipboard:</li>
<li>Chrome is the best, then Safari, and Firefox totally misses the point. I do not know about Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Not all applications treat the pasted HTML equally well:</li>
<li>Good results: Evernote, Apple Mail (both also on iPad)</li>
<li>Reasonable results: Apple Pages, Apple TextEdit, OpenOffice</li>
<li>Bad results: Microsoft Word, except when pasted from Chrome, then it looks really good, except for the fact that FontAwesome is not picked up by Word!</li>
</ul>
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Words across versions</dt>
<dd>The behaviour of word highlighting when switching versions was confusing.
This was caused by the fact that the identifiers of words were not consistent across data versions.
Now I have chosen an identifier scheme that is as consistent as possible across versions.
That means that the color you assign to a word in one version will also be used for the same word in another version of the data.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Multiple data versions</dt>
<dd><p>In the not so distant future we expect a major and stable new release of the ETCBC4 database, to be named ETCBC4s.
We keep the then old ETCBC4 data in SHEBANQ, so that existing queries can be shown exactly as they are now.
We let the ETCBC4 and ETCBC4s coexist in SHEBANQ, and users may execute their queries on both versions of the data.
We also offer an intermediate version, ETCBC4b, that moves from version 4 to 4s over time.
Multiple versions have a big impact on how queries are handled. In short, each query has a version independent part and a version dependent part.
For each version of the data, you can write a separate MQL instruction.
See these help pages:

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sharing, Freezing, Publishing and Citing queries</dt>
<dd>
The notion of publishing query has been split into <i>sharing</i> and <i>freezing</i>.
Sharing is your device to let others see what you have done, without the commitment to keep that always available in the same form.
What was publishing in the old version, is now sharing.
Publishing in the new version is makes the query unchangeable. It then can become part of your scholarly record.
Nobody, not even you can change or delete that query, because it might have been cited in papers.

<li>Queries that were <i>published</i> in the old version are now <i>shared</i>.</li>
<li>No query has been set to <i>published</i> now, you have to do that yourself, if you wish.</li>
<li>Shared queries that had <i>up-to-date</i> results have been re-run off line in order to determine the number of results,
which has been added to the corresponding query execution record.</li>
<li>Such queries have also a copy of the original MQL in a new execution record for ETCBC4b. That makes it very easy for you to see how

<h2>2015-02-26</h2>
<p>A major update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Improved query view</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="ldisc">
<li>Public and private queries integrated in one tree view, with lots of details, such as:
are queries up to date? how many queries per organization, project, person? etc.</li>
<li>Easy expanding and collapsing, easy search;</li>
Instructors can keep a reasonable eye on the collective queries of their students;</li>
<li>Queries can be created and edited from the same tree view;</li>
<li>Providing organization and project metadata is easier.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Reorganized help, documentation and other information</dt>
<dt>Small annoyances have been fixed.</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="ldisc">
<li>The legend window had the habit of suddenly disappearing.</li>
<li>Dictionary pages scrolled to the top when clicking on words at the bottom.</li>
<li>Going back in the browser usually required several go back actions.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Here is an account of the reasons for this update:</dt>
<dd>
<ol class="ldec">
<li>it became increasingly difficult to locate queries of interest among the multitude of public queries</li>
<li>when creating new queries, it was too cumbersome to fill in the relevant organization and project.
Now you create every new query inside an organization and project, amidst a set of existing queries.
This helps to keep the queries organized.</li>
<li>The previous creation/editing functionality was implemented using standard components, and they suffered from several weaknesses:
<ol class="lalph">
<li>they did not function in every context within SHEBANQ where I needed them</li>
<li>it was impossible to provide a good layout for editing forms, a layout that did not consume excessive screen real estate</li>
<li>when a query gets executed or (un)published, some logic has to be carried out.
Everywhere where SHEBANQ allows you to alter these states, this logic should be carried out.
It was difficult to guarantee that when using the standard machinery.</li>
<li>a rather big change is at hand: queries that can be run on several versions of the data.
That means an even more non-standard way of creating/editing queries, and even more logic to be executed when dealing with status changes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>So, I bit the bullet, and implemented a tree view of queries, organized by organization and project and user, and I completely reimplemented
creating and modifying queries, which introduced some unexpected bugs of which some of you have suffered. <b>My sincere apologies</b>.</li>
<li>Although organizations and projects and users seem to be neatly arranged in a simple hierarchy, this is in fact not so.
Some projects occur in multiple organizations.
In fact, there are no links between projects and organizations and users except the queries itself.
A query must link to a project and to an organization and to a user, and only when that happens,
you see that project under that organization and that user under that project.</li>

Moreover, from the public queries page, you can easily copy a mark-down hyperlink to that query, in order to paste it in
the description of an other query. Then your readers can jump to the query that you refer to.

<dt>Better security</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="ldisc">
<li>Non-public queries are no longer visible to non-logged-in users and to users that have not created those queries.
The fact that it was possible (by manipulating the url parameters) was a bug.</li>
<li>SHEBANQ is now much more resistant against manipulation of the url parameters and the cookies.
No matter how contrived the url parameters or the contents of the cookies, SHEBANQ only looks at a definite set of parameters,
and parses their values rigorously. All illegal values are detected and translated to harmless default values.</li>
<li>And where parameters refer to non-existing objects, SHEBANQ detects it and responds gracefully.</li>

<h2>2015-02-07</h2>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Better charts</dt>
<dd>Now the cells in the charts no longer represent chapters but blocks of a fixed size: 500 words, except the last block of a book, which
usually has less words. Blocks cross chapter boundaries, but not book boundaries.
There are 929 chapters, and there are 853 blocks.
The charts now make more sense from a statistical perspective, but navigating to an individual chapter is sometimes less easy, because some blocks contain several chapters.
The color coding has been refined a little.</dd>
<dt>Previous and next controls</dt>
<dd>There are now controls for going to the next and previous page or chapter. So you can page forward and backward without calling up the <i>other pages</i> or 
<i>other chapters</i> dialog.</dd>

<h2>2015-02-04</h2>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Better viewing of query texts</dt>
<dd>The text of a query is where the tricks are played, so they should not be crammed in a small square.
Now they can be viewed on a big canvas in a resizable dialog box.
Endlich können wir die Querien von dem Oliver mal wirklich anschauen!</dd>

<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>new, concise, graphical help</dt>
<dd>{{=A("Check it out now!", _href=URL('default','help'))}}</dd>
<dt>more data!</dt>
<dd>In data view, you can see now almost all of the ETCBC4 features. This has been added:
<ul class="ldisc">
<li>morpheme features:
<code>nme</code>,
<code>pfm</code>,
<code>prs</code>,
<code>uvf</code>,
<code>vbe</code>,
<code>vbs</code>;
</li>
<li>numbering features for
<code>phrase_atom</code>,
<code>clause_atom</code>,
<code>sentence_atom</code>;
</li>
<li>the <code>rela</code> feature has been extended to the object types
<code>phrase</code>,
<code>phrase_atom</code>,
<code>clause</code>;
</li>
<li>clause-atom features:
<code>code</code>,
<code>tab</code>;
</li>
<li>the feature with name <code>domain</code> has been renamed to <code>txt</code>, to match it with the 
name used in the ETCBC4.
There are two related features, <code>txt</code> and <code>domain</code>.
Before this change, SHEBANQ showed the <code>domain</code> features with the values of the <code>txt</code> feature.
Now we show the <code>txt</code> feature with the values of the same <code>txt</code> feature.

<h2>2015-02-02</h2>
<div>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Words: Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon</dt>
<dd>There is a new menu item <i>Words</i> from where you have access to the complete inventory of
Henrew and Aramaic words. Each entry is a clickable link, which brings you to an item page where you
can view all occurrences of that lexeme in context.</dd>
</dl>

<div>
<h2>2015-01-30</h2>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>charts that visualize result sets</dt>
<dd>The result set of a query, and the set of occurrences of a word can be visualized on the fly by a clickable chart.
The chart gives you an overview of where in the bible the members of a result set are, and you can click on the chart
to the specific chapters where members of the chart show up. Check it out!</dd>

<h2>2015-01-29</h2>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>improved responsiveness by refined caching of pages</dt>
<dd>Verse material and lists in the sidebar are being cached. If many users use the same page, regardless
of their view settings, the material that the server sends to the browser is always the same.
These chunks are now being cached.</dd>

<div>
<h2>2015-01-23</h2>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>better editing of queries</dt>
<dd>The window layout when editing queries makes better room for the query text.
The feedback after query execution arrives just below the execute button, and not in a message which must be clicked away.
The edit-execute cycle of query development is much smoother now.</dd>
<dt>extra data field for lexemes</dt>
<dd>By request of Oliver Glanz, a new data field for words has been added, containing the lexeme in its Hebrew, consonantal form, with disambiguation marks.
The contents of this field can be copied and pasted as value for the ``lex_utf8`` feature.
</dd>

<h2>2015-01-21</h2>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>better error reporting</dt>
<dd>Errors in executing queries are better reported now. The error message is shown under the Execute button/</dd>
<dt>performance improvements</dt>
<dd>Executing queries is faster, because the storing of query results has been implemented better.</dd>
<dt>mainainability improved</dt>
<dd>A major hoop has been removed concerning query execution. Before this change, a query was sent to a tomcat service,
that talked through Java bindings with Emdros. Now, Shebanq, which is written in Python, talks directly through Python
bindings with Emdros. This will help future additions of functionality greatly, and it makes Shebanq much easier to
install and maintain. It seems that the performance benefits for individual queries.
It remains to be seen how performance will keep up when doing many concurrent queries.</dd>

<h2>2015-01-15</h2>
<p>A minor update of the SHEBANQ website with:</p>
<dl>
<dt>csv export</dt>
<dd>From the page that shows a list of query results of word occurrence results, you can download a customizable csv file of
the listed items. Each item occupies a row in which also the passage is indicated.
We hope this helps for getting data ready for statistical analysis.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>SHEBANQ goes live, but it is a demonstrator, with open issues.</dt>
<dd>Currently we are aware of:
<ol class="text">
    <li>The query engine might cause exceptions that are not yet handled</li>
    <li>The rendering of the spacing between words is not completely correct, at least in Chrome.
        We have tried
        <a target="_blank" href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ETCBC/laf-fabric-nbs/blob/master/text/font-rendering.ipynb">very hard</a>
        to work around the issues, so that you can enjoy the otherwise beautiful typography even on your iPad.
        N.B.: to our great pleasure we obeserved that as of Safari 7.1 on OSX 10.9.5 there is no need for a work-around anymore.
