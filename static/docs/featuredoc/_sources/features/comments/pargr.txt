Paragraph ``pargr``
---------------------------------------------------
The (sub)paragraph number of a clause atom.

This feature is present on objects of type *clause_atom*.

The value is a section number, like ``1`` or ``1.2`` or ``1.2.3.4``.

This feature has been added to the database in a later stage, but you can use it in SHEBANQ queries.

.. caution::
    I prefer a more informative definition.

    Explain why is this a useful feature? Examples needed.
