Frequency-occurrence ``freq_occ``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The frequency of a word occurrence, measured as the number of occurrences in the whole Hebrew Bible.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

What is counted is the consonantal representation of the words, without accents.

.. note::
    This feature does not distinguish between homonyms, i.e. it counts representations and lexeme distinctions
    are not taken into account.

.. hint::
    The measures *frequency* and *rank* have been computed for *lexemes* and *occurrences*.
