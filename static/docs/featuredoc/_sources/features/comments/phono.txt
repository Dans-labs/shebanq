Word -full-phonetic ``phono``
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The phonetic representation of a word occurrence.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

There is also a feature ``phono_sep`` which gives the material between the next word and the current word.

If you concatenate the ``phono`` and ``phono_sep`` features of each word, you get the complete text with correct
spacing and newlines in phonetic representation.

The full Hebrew word has been transcribed, and accents have been transformed to primary and secondary stress marks.
