Instruction ``instruction``
---------------------------------------------------
The so called instruction of a clause atom.

This feature is present on objects of type *clause_atom*.

The value is something like ``.q``, ``..``, ``.d``, ``ve``.

This feature has been added to the database in a later stage, but you can use it in SHEBANQ queries.

.. caution::
    I prefer a more informative definition.

    Explain why is this a useful feature? Examples needed.
