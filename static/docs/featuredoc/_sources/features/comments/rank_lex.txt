Rank-lexeme ``rank_lex``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rank of a lexeme, a measure related to its frequency.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

The rank of an item is the number of items that have a higher frequency.
So items with rank 0 have the highest frequency.
If two or more items have identical frequency, they have the same rank, but the rank immediately below is not one lower, but *n* lower,
where *n* is the amount of items with that same frequency.

.. note::
    The ETCBC lexicon makes distinctions between homonyms, i.e. distinct lexemes that are spelled identically.
    This feature respects that distinction.

.. hint::
    The measures *frequency* and *rank* have been computed for *lexemes* and *occurrences*.
