Gloss ``gloss``
---------------
A short English translation of a single word, disregarding context.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

The *gloss* cannot be used to generate a proper translation.
Many words have multiple meanings and a good translation chooses between them.
The glosses are not guaranteed to mention all possible meanings, and they 
do not contain heuristics which meanings should be selected in which contexts.

The *gloss* is useful for users with limited knowledge of Hebrew to get an impression
of what the text they are reading is about.

.. note:: 
    This is not a feature of the ETCBC4 Hebrew Text Database.
    Every word occurrence in the database is linked to a lexicon entry.
    The values of *gloss* are given in the lexicon only.

.. hint::
    In LAF-Fabric, the lexicon material is added, rather uneconomically, as extra features 
    of the word occurrences. 
    You can load these features by invoking the extra annotation package *lexicon*, and after
    that the gloss can be used under the name ``gloss``.
