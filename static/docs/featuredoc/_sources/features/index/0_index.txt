Feature Values
=============================

.. caution::
    Version **etcbc4c** is available from
    `text-fabric-data <https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric-data>`_.
    The set of features has changed slightly.
    A corresponding **new version** of this feature documentation is available at
    `text-fabric-data: docs <https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/0_overview.html>`_.
    
    Data version **etcbc4c** is not (yet) available in SHEBANQ, 
    only in 
    `Text-Fabric <https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/wiki>`_,
    the successor of LAF-Fabric.
    LAF-Fabric stays around in order to run legacy notebooks.
    It is recommended to use **Text-Fabric** for new work.
